# Donner 2025

## 3D Scan of our freshman dorm with interactive memories

As I end my freshman year, I felt compelled to give back to the best dorm at Stanford that has made our year just so special. With inspiration from [@eiiot](https://github.com/eiiot), who set up various services like Donner Dash (same-day Target delivery for our dorm!), I created Donner Scan, a 3D walkthrough map of the last day of our dorm as I recorded it on poly.cam (only ~300 photos, no lidar!) 

The goal was for my friends to send me any photos they wanted to memorialize forever on the site, and I could keep it on the site as we experienced it in real life. The scan ended up being surprisingly good for a last minute attempt; if I could do it again I definitely would've gotten better shots of the ping pong table and the piano, but otherwise I'm really happy with it.
